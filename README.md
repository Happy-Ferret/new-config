Take a look at it: https://kammueller.github.io/new-config/warning.html


#### Things to Know ####
The following basic Logic is included:
- jump from the warning page to the real content page
- clicking 'Add a Preference' triggers the visibility of the corresponding form
- when editing an integer, checks are performed whether you really enter an int
- if you add a pref you get the "double naming" feedback
